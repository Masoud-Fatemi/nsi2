## Overview
 - to pilot Chunyun idea for the **Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)**,


 ## Copied files 
 - the row extracted values for UK from the **next/data/au.csv**
 - the row extracted values for UK from the **next/data/uk.csv**
 - the row extracted values for UK from the **next/data/us.csv**
 - extracted measures in the UK file are not normalized and not reverse scaled.
 - **df.csv** copied from **neologism/data**

 ## Output
 - the 8 measures columns are raw values --> not normalized, not reverse-scaled
 - the nsi column is the same as alpha-8 and comes from the df.csv --> caluculated based on normalized and reverse-scaled measures
